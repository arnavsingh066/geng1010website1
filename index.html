    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What's different between us and a normal recycling bin?</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        1 - Normal plastic bins are always bulky, and take up floor space. Our bins are designed to stack vertically, making the process of transportation from Saibai Island a lot easier and efficient.<br>
        2 - Regular bins often accept mixed materials, but on our small island, ECOSTACK focuses on sorting our plastics to improve plastic waste management.<br>
        3 - Saibai Island has a diverse landscape full of insects. We know how tiring it can be dealing with them. So ECOSTACK is built with a tight sealing mechanism to keep insects out and waste secure.
